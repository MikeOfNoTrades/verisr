verision 2.0:

* added sample data "veris.sample", this will allow quick exploration and samples to function
* foldmatrix: several arguments were changed and removed, will require rework in existing code.
* foldmatrix: enabled seperate variables of "rows" and "cols" to specify the rows and columns of output matrix 
* foldmatrix: rows can be a named list of logical to be used as a filter, or a list of column names of logicals
* foldmatrix: the "clean" variable is now defaulting to TRUE
* getenumlist is removed, the new data.table format allows direct query of columns

Version 2.0.1:

* a few bug fixes, problems with json loading in json2veris() is fixed
* getenum and getenumby() are now one function that are interchangable
* internal `getpattern` function now returns a data table to cbind with core data set, it enables querying for "pattern" in getenum in an easier way.
* getenum with more than one enum (what getenumby() did), now returns a different column name, since the columns are now bound by a "primary" qnd "secondary" limitation the columns are named "enum", "enum1", "enum2" and so on for each enum passed in.
